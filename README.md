# *Hi, I'm Michael Newcomer!*

Passionate developer who loves building things that make life easier — from small tools to full applications.
If it runs on a computer (or occasionally a microcontroller), I probably want to code for it.

## 🧠 What I Do

I enjoy turning ideas into real, working software.
Web apps, games, mobile apps, weird experiments — whatever scratches the curiosity itch.

Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me biking, exploring, or thinking about the next project I shouldn’t start but probably will anyway.
